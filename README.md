# Hercule-Poirot-Episode-JSON-Data

This file represents the contents of the Hercule Poirot Episode Database in JSON format.

It was created using BeautifulSoup and then adding tropes, crimes and characters based on repeated viewings of the series. 

When the REST API (https://github.com/n8k/HPDB_REST_API) is working, you can simply POST this data, and it will be added to the database.
